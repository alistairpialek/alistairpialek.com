<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I'm a Platform Engineer in Sydney, Australia.</p>

<p>
  I work with AWS, Terraform, Docker and lots of other technologies to create ECS, EKS and Serverless solutions.
  Ruby and Go are my favourite programming languages.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time I run my local and not so local trails and work on my home automation projects.
