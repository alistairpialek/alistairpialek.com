<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I'm a Software Engineer living in Sydney, Australia.</p>

<p>
  I work with AWS, Terraform, Docker and lots of other technologies to create ECS, EKS and serverless solutions.
  I enjoy working with Ruby and Go when I get the chance.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time I run my local and not so local trails and work on my home automation projects.
