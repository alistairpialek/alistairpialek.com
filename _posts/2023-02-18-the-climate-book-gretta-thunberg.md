An amazing, insightful and deeply moving read about all aspects of climate change and how as a species we're
doing a pretty fantastic job at destroying the planet.

A big highlight for me was around social inequality. The fact that we have the richest,
most affluent people and countries in the world contributing the most to CO2 emissions while those in poverty
contributing the least and suffering the most from it. Particularly those in sub-saharan countries.

Another is around a country's GDP and how this runs negatively towards its environmental impact and emissions.
GPD _can_ be decoupled from emissions, by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy. The problem is that
decarbonization cannot be accomplished fast enough to meet the Paris targets _if high-income economies continue
to grow at their current rates_. More growth means more energy demand, and more energy demand makes it more difficult -
and probably impossible - to reduce emissions to zero at a sufficiently rapid rate.

Which ties into Naomi Klein's essay _A Just Transition_ which deeply summarized; asserts that the bottomless quest for
profits that forces so many to work upwards of fifty hours a week with no security, fuelling an epidemic of isolation
and despair, is the same quest for bottomless profits that has pushed our planet into peril.

Margaret Atwood's essay on _Practical Utopias_ and her novel _Onyx and Crake_ was a real eye-opener on the idea that we
currently have the capability to bioengineer a virus capable of wiping out humanity very swiftly; and that someone
might be tempted to do just that, in order to save the entire biosphere and all life within it from the destruction
at the hands of our species. If humanity goes, the rest of life stays; but if not, then not. I hope this doesn't happen
but it does make me want to read Bill Gate's _How To Prevent the Next Pandemic_ in my next few books.

Finally, its very obvious that we are not treating the climate disaster currently unfolding as such. And an insightful
set of markers was provided by Seth Klein in his essay _A Genuine Emergency Response_ (drawing parallels to the
emergency response witnessed during the Covid-19 pandemic) which indicates that a government has shifted into emergency mode.

1. Spend what it takes to win. As C. D. Howe, Canadian Minister of Munitions and Supply stated during the Second World War,
   'If we lose the war, nothing else will matter... if we win the war, the cost will have been of no consequence and will
   have been forgotten.'
1. Create new economic institutions to get the job done.
1. Shift from voluntary and incentive-based policies to mandatory measures (such as wearing a face mask).
1. Tell the truth about the severity of the crisis (such as was seen with daily Covid-19 updates).

A highly recommended read.
