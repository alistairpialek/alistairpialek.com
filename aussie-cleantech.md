#### Aussie cleantech startups to watch

Cleantech startups in Australia are rapidily evolving and maturing and it's an exciting space to keep apart of.
Unfortunately, discovering these companies is often a bit tricky, so here's a list of some of the companies I am most
excited about (in no particular order) grouped by the area of cleantech they are focusing on.

##### Emissions Offset

[Trace][1]

Personal and business orientated carbon emissions measurement and offsetting via verified carbon reduction projects
and tree planting. I particularly like how they are holistically looking at CO2 emissions measurement which keeps the
door open to providing energy, transport and waste reduction advice and feature sets.

##### Solar and Battery Management

[Reposit][2]

Managed solar and battery system installation with a 5 year no bill guarantee. Very catchy.

##### Retail Offerings

[Amber Energy][3]

With a $15 per month subscription, provides customers with access to wholesale energy prices and the Amber app which
enables users to shift their energy usage to match market price changes due to more or less green energy being supplied
to the grid. Access to wholesale prices (and an API!) is very progressive for an energy retailer. Savy solar and battery
owners can play the wholesale energy price game to save and make money.

##### B2B

[Upowr][4]

Helps businesses design and quote clean energy products for customers. For solar panels, AI and aerial imagery is used
to help quote on time and labor. For batteries, generation and consumption modelling allows precise Time of Use and VPP
savings calculations.
